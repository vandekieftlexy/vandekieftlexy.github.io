    Working with P5 was a very valuable experience which introduced me to an important new concept. The Bubbles Mini Challenge mainly
involved JavaScript objects, which is when information is stored in one variable. These objects can then have individual properties.
One advantage of learning how to use objects is that almost any data can be stored within them. Therefore, understanding how to use
them will give me many more capabilities as a JavaScript user. I'm starting to see how JavaScript could be used to create
different kinds of games or applications. Initially, I found the different functions to be tricky. The sizes of the bubbles go in the
setup function, while the other information (such as the ellipse part which gives the bubble it circular shape) goes in the draw function.
In the future I feel that I may have trouble remembering which aspects of the program belong in which function, but I am sure that
with practice it will become easier to remember.
    Overall, I really enjoyed my first encounter with P5! I look forward to becoming more adept with using it and seeing what else
I can create!
